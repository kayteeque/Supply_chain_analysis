# Supply_chain_analysis
In this project I gather data pertaining to Suppliers from an open-sourced dataset containing supply chain data. I analyze the data for any correlations between intuitive numerical variables such as Lead Time v Production Volumes as well as others such as Manufacturing Lead time v Manufacturing costs. I gather and compute Inspection Fail rates for ALL Suppliers. I convert categorical variables into numerical for computation of individual supplier Inspection fail rates. I give a summarized report of my findings, visualize the data and give my analysis on which Suppliers are not optimally performing.
